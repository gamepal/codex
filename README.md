# LBE System Skeleton

This repository contains a minimal example of a location-based entertainment system. The structure is split into four components:

1. **server** – Java server acting as a simple message hub for broadcasting between clients.
2. **pda** – Unity C# script for sending VR login information.
3. **vr** – Unity C# script for synchronising other players' positions.
4. **control** – Unity C# script placeholder for management functions.

Each component is highly simplified and intended only as a starting point.
